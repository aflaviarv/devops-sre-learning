# DevOps & SRE Learning Repository

## Purpose
This repository serves as a structured learning path for transitioning from IT Project Management to DevOps and Site Reliability Engineering (SRE). It acts as a central hub for consolidating knowledge, hands-on projects, and practical exercises covering DevOps principles, automation, CI/CD, cloud infrastructure, and observability.

## Objectives
- **Master Git & GitHub**: Establish version control best practices and repository management.
- **Develop DevOps Skills**: Learn and apply DevOps methodologies, CI/CD pipelines, and automation tools.
- **Gain Hands-on Experience**: Work on real-world projects to solidify technical knowledge.
- **Strengthen Cloud Expertise**: Deepen understanding of cloud architecture, networking, and security.
- **Transition to SRE**: Understand reliability engineering principles, incident management, and system scalability.
- **Document Learning Progress**: Maintain a well-structured knowledge base for future reference and collaboration.

## Roadmap
The learning journey follows a logical progression, starting with foundational concepts and gradually advancing to more complex topics:

### 1. Version Control & Collaboration
- **Git Fundamentals**: Commits, branches, merges, and rebases.
- **GitHub Best Practices**: Repository structure, issues, pull requests, and workflows.
- **Git Workflows**: Feature branching, GitFlow, and trunk-based development.

### 2. Automation & Scripting
- **Shell Scripting**: Bash scripting for task automation.
- **Python for DevOps**: Writing scripts for automation and infrastructure management.
- **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**: Terraform, AWS CloudFormation, and Ansible.

### 3. Cloud & Infrastructure
- **Cloud Fundamentals**: Key concepts of cloud computing (IaaS, PaaS, SaaS).
- **AWS Core Services**:
  - Compute: EC2, Lambda, ECS, EKS.
  - Storage: S3, EBS, EFS.
  - Networking: VPC, Route 53, ELB, CloudFront.
  - Security: IAM, KMS, Security Groups, WAF.
- **GCP Core Services**:
  - Compute: Compute Engine, Cloud Functions, GKE.
  - Storage: Cloud Storage, Persistent Disks.
  - Networking: VPC, Cloud Load Balancing, Cloud DNS.
  - Security: IAM, Cloud Identity, Security Command Center.
- **Azure Core Services**:
  - Compute: Virtual Machines, Azure Functions, AKS.
  - Storage: Azure Blob Storage, Azure Files.
  - Networking: Virtual Network, Azure Load Balancer, Azure DNS.
  - Security: Azure Active Directory, Key Vault, Defender for Cloud.
- **Multi-cloud Strategy**: Understanding cross-cloud deployments and hybrid environments.
- **Networking for Cloud**: VPCs, Subnets, CIDR, Peering, VPNs, and Direct Connect.
- **Security Best Practices**: IAM roles, least privilege access, encryption, and compliance.

### 4. Containerization & Orchestration
- **Docker**: Image creation, Dockerfiles, container management.
- **Kubernetes (K8s)**:
  - Pods, Deployments, Services, and ConfigMaps.
  - Helm for package management.
  - Kubernetes networking and security.
  - Cluster monitoring and scaling.

### 5. CI/CD & Configuration Management
- **Continuous Integration (CI)**: GitHub Actions, Jenkins, GitLab CI.
- **Continuous Deployment (CD)**: Automated deployment strategies.
- **Configuration Management**: Ansible, Chef, Puppet.
- **Artifact Management**: Docker Hub, JFrog Artifactory.

### 6. Observability & Reliability
- **Monitoring & Logging**:
  - CloudWatch, Datadog, Prometheus, Grafana.
  - Centralized logging with ELK stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana).
- **Tracing & Alerting**:
  - Distributed tracing with OpenTelemetry.
  - Alerting strategies and incident management.
- **Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) Principles**:
  - SLIs, SLOs, SLAs.
  - Error budgets and reliability best practices.
