# Git Theory

## Introduction
Git is a distributed version control system that allows multiple developers to work on a project simultaneously while tracking changes efficiently. It provides a structured approach to source code management, ensuring collaboration, traceability, and rollback capabilities.

## Why Use Git?
- **Version Control**: Keeps track of changes in the codebase over time.
- **Collaboration**: Enables multiple developers to work on the same project without conflicts.
- **Branching and Merging**: Supports feature development in isolated branches before integrating into the main codebase.
- **Backup and Recovery**: Ensures project safety by maintaining a history of all changes.
- **Efficiency**: Lightweight and fast, allowing easy tracking of modifications.

## Core Concepts
### 1. Repositories
A Git repository is a storage location for code and history. It can be local (on your machine) or remote (hosted on platforms like GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket).

### 2. Commits
Commits are snapshots of your project at a specific point in time. They include changes made to files, along with a message describing the modifications.

### 3. Branches
Branches enable parallel development by creating independent lines of code. The default branch is usually `main` or `master`.

### 4. Merging
Merging combines changes from different branches into a single branch. Common strategies include fast-forward and three-way merge.

### 5. Remote Repositories
Remote repositories are hosted on platforms like GitHub. Changes can be pushed (`git push`) or pulled (`git pull`) to sync with other contributors.

## Essential Git Commands
| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `git init` | Initializes a new Git repository |
| `git clone <repo>` | Clones a remote repository to your local machine |
| `git status` | Shows the status of changes in the working directory |
| `git add <file>` | Stages a file for commit |
| `git commit -m "message"` | Commits staged changes with a message |
| `git branch` | Lists available branches |
| `git checkout <branch>` | Switches to a different branch |
| `git merge <branch>` | Merges the specified branch into the current branch |
| `git pull` | Fetches and merges changes from a remote repository |
| `git push` | Pushes committed changes to a remote repository |

## Best Practices
- **Write meaningful commit messages**: Clearly describe changes for better traceability.
- **Use branches effectively**: Separate feature development, bug fixes, and releases.
- **Pull before pushing**: Always sync with the remote repository before pushing changes.
- **Avoid committing unnecessary files**: Use `.gitignore` to exclude temporary files.
- **Review changes before merging**: Ensure smooth integration by checking pull requests or reviewing code diffs.
