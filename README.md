# DevOps & SRE Learning Repository

## Purpose
This repository serves as a structured learning path for transitioning from IT Project Management to DevOps and Site Reliability Engineering (SRE). It acts as a central hub for consolidating knowledge, hands-on projects, and practical exercises covering DevOps principles, automation, CI/CD, cloud infrastructure, and observability.

## Objectives
- **Master Git & GitHub**: Establish version control best practices and repository management.
- **Develop DevOps Skills**: Learn and apply DevOps methodologies, CI/CD pipelines, and automation tools.
- **Gain Hands-on Experience**: Work on real-world projects to solidify technical knowledge.
- **Strengthen Cloud Expertise**: Deepen understanding of cloud architecture, networking, and security.
- **Transition to SRE**: Understand reliability engineering principles, incident management, and system scalability.
- **Document Learning Progress**: Maintain a well-structured knowledge base for future reference and collaboration.

## Roadmap
The learning journey follows a logical progression, starting with foundational concepts and gradually advancing to more complex topics:

### 1. Version Control & Collaboration
- **Git Fundamentals**: Commits, branches, merges, and rebases.
- **GitHub Best Practices**: Repository structure, issues, pull requests, and workflows.
- **Git Workflows**: Feature branching, GitFlow, and trunk-based development.

### 2. Cloud & Infrastructure
- **Cloud Fundamentals**: Key concepts of cloud computing (IaaS, PaaS, SaaS).
- **AWS Core Services**:
  - Compute: EC2, Lambda, ECS, EKS.
  - Storage: S3, EBS, EFS.
  - Networking: VPC, Route 53, ELB, CloudFront.
  - Security: IAM, KMS, Security Groups, WAF.
- **Multi-cloud Strategy**: Understanding cross-cloud deployments and hybrid environments.
- **Networking for Cloud**: VPCs, Subnets, CIDR, Peering, VPNs, and Direct Connect.
- **Security Best Practices**: IAM roles, least privilege access, encryption, and compliance.

### 3. Linux
- **Basic Commands**: File system navigation, permissions, and process management.
- **Shell Scripting**: Automating tasks with Bash.
- **Networking in Linux**: Understanding firewalls, ports, and traffic monitoring.

### 4. Networking
- **Networking Fundamentals**: TCP/IP, DNS, HTTP/S, VPNs.
- **Cloud Networking**: VPCs, load balancing, and direct connections.
- **Troubleshooting**: Common networking issues and debugging tools.

### 5. CI/CD & Automation
- **Continuous Integration (CI)**: GitHub Actions, Jenkins, GitLab CI.
- **Continuous Deployment (CD)**: Automated deployment strategies.
- **Configuration Management**: Ansible, Chef, Puppet.
- **Artifact Management**: Docker Hub, JFrog Artifactory.

### 6. Containerization
- **Docker**: Image creation, Dockerfiles, container management.
- **Kubernetes (K8s)**:
  - Pods, Deployments, Services, and ConfigMaps.
  - Helm for package management.
  - Kubernetes networking and security.
  - Cluster monitoring and scaling.

### 7. Infrastructure as Code (IaC)
- **Terraform**: Infrastructure provisioning and management.
- **Best Practices**: State management, modules, and security considerations.

### 8. Monitoring & Observability
- **Monitoring Tools**: CloudWatch, Datadog, Prometheus, Grafana.
- **Centralized Logging**: ELK stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana).
- **Tracing & Alerting**:
  - Distributed tracing with OpenTelemetry.
  - Alerting strategies and incident management.

### 9. Site Reliability Engineering (SRE)
- **SRE Principles**: SLIs, SLOs, SLAs.
- **Error Budgets & Reliability**: Measuring and improving system reliability.
- **Incident Management**: Handling on-call rotations, postmortems, and continuous improvement.
- **Automation & Resilience**: Reducing toil through automation, chaos engineering, and self-healing systems.
