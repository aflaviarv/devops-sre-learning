[![Typing SVG](https://readme-typing-svg.herokuapp.com?color=%2336BCF7&lines=DevOps+%26+SRE+Learning+Roadmap;AWS+Focused+Study+Plan;Continuous+Improvement)](https://git.io/typing-svg)


## 📌 Purpose
This repository is a **study roadmap** focused on **DevOps and Site Reliability Engineering (SRE)**. 

It serves as a structured **learning space** to document **experiments, tests, and practical applications** of DevOps concepts. **Not everything here is guaranteed to work—this is a space for trial, error, and learning.** As new concepts are explored, they may be adjusted, expanded, or even completely reworked.

This is a **work-in-progress repository** that evolves over time as new knowledge is gained.

---

## 🎯 Why Did I Create This Repository?
- **A structured study roadmap**, helping to build a solid foundation in AWS, DevOps & SRE.
- **A place to test theories**, apply concepts, and document findings—whether successful or not.
- **A continuously evolving knowledge base**, rather than a fixed learning guide.
- **Not a sandbox, but a learning space**—things here might not work as expected, and that’s okay.

---

## 🛠 Tech Stack (Explored Topics)
This repository is focused on **AWS-based DevOps & SRE concepts**, including:
- **Version Control & CI/CD**: Git, GitHub, GitHub Actions.
- **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**: Terraform.
- **AWS Cloud & Networking**: VPC, Load Balancers, Security Groups.
- **Containerization & Orchestration**: Docker, Kubernetes, AWS ECS.
- **Monitoring & Observability**: **Datadog** (primary focus).
- **Security & Compliance**: IAM, WAF, TLS/SSL.

💡 *This is an evolving list—new technologies may be added as I progress in my studies.*

## 📌 Study Methodology
This repository follows an **iterative learning approach**:
1. **Start with theoretical research**: Understand core concepts and industry best practices.
2. **Apply in a study environment**: Run experiments, troubleshoot, and validate ideas.
3. **Document findings and lessons learned**: Whether something works or fails, recording insights helps reinforce learning.
4. **Refactor and optimize**: Continuously improve methods, adopt new strategies, and expand technical depth.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- **Master Git & GitHub**: Establish version control best practices and repository management.
- **Develop DevOps Skills**: Learn and apply DevOps methodologies, CI/CD pipelines, and automation tools.
- **Gain Hands-on Experience**: Work on real-world projects to solidify technical knowledge.
- **Strengthen Cloud Expertise**: Deepen understanding of cloud architecture, networking, and security.
- **Transition to SRE**: Understand reliability engineering principles, incident management, and system scalability.
- **Document Learning Progress**: Maintain a well-structured knowledge base for future reference and collaboration.
