#DevOps & SRE Learning Repository

## Purpose
This repository serves as a structured learning path for transitioning from IT Project Management to DevOps and Site Reliability Engineering (SRE). It acts as a central hub for consolidating knowledge, hands-on projects, and practical exercises covering DevOps principles, automation, CI/CD, cloud infrastructure, and observability.

## Objectives
- **Master Git & GitHub**: Establish version control best practices and repository management.
- **Develop DevOps Skills**: Learn and apply DevOps methodologies, CI/CD pipelines, and automation tools.
- **Gain Hands-on Experience**: Work on real-world projects to solidify technical knowledge.
- **Strengthen Cloud Expertise**: Deepen understanding of cloud architecture, networking, and security.
- **Transition to SRE**: Understand reliability engineering principles, incident management, and system scalability.
- **Document Learning Progress**: Maintain a well-structured knowledge base for future reference and collaboration.

## Roadmap
