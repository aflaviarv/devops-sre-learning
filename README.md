# DevOps & SRE Learning
## DevOps & SRE Learning Repository

### Purpose
This repository was created as a structured learning path for transitioning from IT Project Management to DevOps and Site Reliability Engineering (SRE). It serves as a central hub for consolidating knowledge, hands-on projects, and practical exercises related to DevOps principles, automation, CI/CD, cloud infrastructure, and observability.

### Objectives
- **Master Git & GitHub**: Establish version control best practices and repository management.
- **Develop DevOps Skills**: Learn and apply DevOps methodologies, CI/CD pipelines, and automation tools.
- **Gain Hands-on Experience**: Work on real-world projects to solidify technical knowledge.
- **Transition to SRE**: Understand reliability engineering principles, incident management, and system scalability.
- **Document Learning Progress**: Maintain a well-structured knowledge base for future reference and collaboration.

### Roadmap
The learning journey follows a logical progression, starting with foundational concepts and gradually advancing to more complex topics:
1. **Version Control & Collaboration**: Git, GitHub, best practices.
2. **Automation & Scripting**: Bash, Python, Infrastructure as Code (IaC).
3. **Containerization & Orchestration**: Docker, Kubernetes.
4. **CI/CD & Configuration Management**: Jenkins, GitHub Actions, Ansible.
5. **Cloud & Infrastructure**: AWS fundamentals, Terraform, monitoring tools.
6. **Observability & Reliability**: Logging, tracing, alerting, and SRE principles.
